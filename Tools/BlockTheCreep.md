# BlockTheCreep: A Stalker-Detection & Blocking Tool

**Protect yourself from online stalkers and unwanted tracking!**

---

## Overview
**BlockTheCreep** is designed to help women (and anyone concerned about personal privacy) detect and prevent digital stalking. By leveraging APIs and tracking-detection techniques, this tool empowers users to identify suspicious behavior and block repeated offenders before it escalates.

---

## Goals
- **Primary:** Detect if someone is persistently viewing your online profiles or tracking your activity.  
- **Secondary:** Automatically block or alert you to suspicious accounts and repeated visits.

---

## Key Features
1. **Stalker Detection**  
   - Monitors LinkedIn, Facebook, or Instagram profile views (via respective APIs).  
   - Flags repeated visits and unusual traffic patterns.

2. **Data Tracking Alerts**  
   - Scans cookies and analytics data (e.g., Google Analytics) to see if your info is being tracked.  
   - Notifies you when tracking pixels or unusual scripts are detected.

3. **Automated Blocking**  
   - Uses IP tracking to spot repeated visits from the same source.  
   - Automatically blocks or prompts user to block suspicious accounts.

## How It Works
1. **API Integration**  
   - Connects to social media APIs (LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram) to read visit data (when available).  
   - Collects timestamps, visitor info, and other relevant statistics.

2. **Tracking Analysis**  
   - Monitors common tracking tools to detect suspicious patterns.  
   - Alerts you to potential stalkers who repeatedly access your profiles.

3. **IP & Cookie Management**  
   - Collects IP addresses and correlates them with known suspicious behavior.  
   - Gives the option to block or ignore certain IPs, based on your preferences.

## Tech Stack
- **Back-End:** Python (Flask for RESTful APIs)  
- **Front-End:** JavaScript (for web-based tracking and alerts)  
- **Database:** SQL or NoSQL for storing logs, visitor data, and flagged profiles  
- **Additional Tools:**  
  - OSINT for gathering publicly available data on suspicious visitors  
  - Cloud hosting (AWS, Heroku, etc.) for deployment

## Why This is Great
- **Empowers Users:** Especially women who face heightened risks of cyberstalking and harassment.  
- **High Impact:** Addresses a significant, real-world safety concern.  
- **Scalable:** Could evolve into a comprehensive cyber-safety suite, including mobile apps or browser extensions.

## Difficulty Level
**Medium-Hard**  
- Requires API integrations with major social platforms.  
- Involves handling sensitive data and privacy concerns.  
- Demands robust security measures to protect user information.
