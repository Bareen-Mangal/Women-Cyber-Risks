## **🔥 The Digital Threats Women Face**  
You’ve probably heard about **cyberbullying** and **doxxing**, but online harassment is evolving, and we **need to stay ahead of it**. Here are some of the biggest cyber risks for women today:  

### **📌 AI & Deepfake Harassment**  
Attackers are using **AI-generated deepfakes** to create fake explicit images of women, often for blackmail, public shaming, or revenge. These can spread quickly, even if they’re completely **fake**.  

🔹 **Protect yourself:** Regularly **reverse-search your images** using [Google Images](https://images.google.com/) or [TinEye](https://tineye.com/).

### **📌 Doxxing & Digital Exposure**  
Attackers **leak personal data** (home address, phone number, workplace) to harass or intimidate women. This has led to **real-life threats, stalking, and even swatting attacks**.  

🔹 **Protect yourself:**  
✔️ **Google yourself** regularly and request removal of personal data using [Google's Remove Request](https://support.google.com/websearch/troubleshooter/3111061?hl=en).  
✔️ **Use a P.O. Box** for public records instead of your real address.
