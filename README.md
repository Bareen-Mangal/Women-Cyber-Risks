# 🛡️ Women & Cyber Risks  
💡 A repository dedicated to raising awareness about **gender-based cyber threats, online harassment, and digital privacy for women and girls.**  

## 🔍 Why This Matters  
For too long, **women and girls have been forced to navigate the internet in fear**—fear of harassment, fear of exposure, fear of simply existing online. While the internet has given us a voice, it has also become a battlefield where **women are disproportionately targeted, silenced, and attacked.**  

We are affected by:  
- **Cyberstalking & Online Harassment** – Being threatened, followed, and attacked simply for speaking up.  
- **Doxxing & Privacy Violations** – Having our personal information leaked to expose or harm us.  
- **Sextortion & Revenge Porn** – Our dignity, our trust, weaponized against us.  
- **Gender-Based Cyber Attacks** – Being bombarded with hate, threats, and misogyny, just for existing.  
- **Deepfake & AI-Based Harassment** – Seeing our faces manipulated into things we never did.  

🚨 **Women should not have to accept online violence as the price of participation.** The digital world must be a place where we feel safe, respected, and protected.

## ✨ Why I Created This  
I’m not just someone who studies **IT security**—I’m a **woman who has lived in fear of the digital world**. I know what it’s like to **second-guess sharing a picture, to hesitate before posting an opinion, to wonder if my words will make me a target**.  

💡 **I chose cybersecurity because I refused to be powerless. Because I refuse to let other women feel powerless.**  

Growing up as an **Afghan woman**, I’ve seen what it means to have **no digital rights, no protections, and no voice**. **In Afghanistan, women don’t just face online harassment—they face an entire system that refuses to acknowledge their existence, let alone their rights.**  

📢 This repository is my **small act of defiance**—a step towards **breaking the silence**, towards **creating something real** for all women, but especially for **Afghan women who are denied even the most basic protections**.  

I hope that one day, this isn’t just a GitHub repository. **I hope it becomes a real solution. A platform. A movement. A way to fight back.**  

Because **if no one else will create safety for us, then we will create it for ourselves.**
